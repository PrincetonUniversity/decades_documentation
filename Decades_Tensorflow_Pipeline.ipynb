This API allows you to easily write NN applications without having to worry about detailed TensorFlow backend functions. We support the entire Keras API, so you can utilize any Keras API function. Our main functions of interest are the commonly used functions that appear in many NN applications and largely contribute to total computation time. We list these functions below:"

You first write your application using Keras functions (you can find many examples [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples)), like you normally would.
