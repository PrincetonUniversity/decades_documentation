The feature of Numba that we are most interested in is its use of LLVM to compile Python code (read more about LLVM [here](https://llvm.org)).

    "### Appendix 2 Tips and tricks with Numba:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Most common error you will encounter:** By far the most common error you will come across is going to be due to variable type settings. You will get an error similar to \"TypeError: No matching definition for argument type(s) array(float32, 1d, C), array(int64, 1d, C), array(int64, 1d, C)\" in such cases. You need to make sure that Python and Numpy variables are cast into specific data types your Numba function expects. Numba does not give very good description of the issues in the error, so you might need to do some detective work to understand which variable or function it is complaining about.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Python default integer type:** Numba type of a python generated default integer is int64. You may need to cast it to a different type if this is not what you wanted in the numba code. You can do `np.int32(x)` if you want to cast it to int32 for instance.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Assigning values to output array:** When you construct a kernel to be launched by the `decades_kernel_launcher`, you will need to provide the return output as an initialized input. If this variable is an array, in order to assign values to the entire array you would normally do `returnarray = ...` However this will result in creation of a new object inside the numba function rather than changing its content. You therefore have to do `returnarray[:] = ...` . This is not an issue if you need to do this: `returnarray[i]=...`.\n",
    " <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **List of objects:** If you need to have a list of objects in your input arguments, the signature you need to use for that is `List(ObjectType)`. \n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Appending to numpy arrays:** It is very costly to do appending or concatenation operations with numpy arrays. Therefore we recommend using fixed size arrays (with an initial max size) and keep track of the end of the array using an integer variable.\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Index out of range:** Numba unfortunately will let you assign a value out or range of an array and result in `core dump`. If you see this issue, inpect your code to be sure you are not trying to access a location out of range of an array.\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Consistent variable types:** For any operation inside a Numba compiled function, you need to have consistent variable types. to give an example in `np.zeros((a, b))`, `a` and `b` must have the same integer type.\n",

    " - **Lists versus numpy arrays:** Although Numba supports lists, note that it does not support list of lists. It would be wise to use numpy arrays instead of lists. This way, you will be less prone to coming across errors and bugs related to whether or not Numba can handle the python  functions associated with lists. There may however be situations where using lists is much more convenient, in those cases make sure the types of the variables inside the list are compatible with operations you will do with them.\n",

    " - **Variable types in Numba**:\n",
    "Since you will need to declare the type of the input and output variables of your njit function, let's talk about different variable types you might have to deal with. \n",
    "As we said above, safest type of variables to use in Numba are Numpy variables where most of the methods associated with these variables are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used variable types are as follows:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "      <tr><td><font size=\"3\">int32</td><td> <font size=\"3\">integer variable</td></tr>\n",
    "      <tr><td><font size=\"3\">int32[:] </td><td><font size=\"3\">integer array</td></tr>\n",
    "      <tr><td><font size=\"3\">int32[:,:] </td><td><font size=\"3\">2D integer array</td></tr>\n",
    "      <tr><td><font size=\"3\">int32[:,::1] </td><td><font size=\"3\">2D integer array, packed row-wise</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td><font size=\"3\">... </td><td>...</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "where int32 can be replaced by int8, int16, int64, float32 and float64. The output variables must be wrapped in a Numba Tuple if there are more than one. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use jitclasses as input and output variables and in that case you need to capture the class signature by adding .class_type.instance_type at the end of a class name and use this signature as variable type.\n",
    "\n",
