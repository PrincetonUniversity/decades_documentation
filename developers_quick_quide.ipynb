    "Hello and welcome to the DECADES platform!\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In this document we provide links to reference documents you can go through to start your experience with developing with DECADES platform.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To learn more about DECADES architecture, please have a look at some slides [here](DECADES_Doc_and_Specs.pdf)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A good place to start is the [Decades Programmer Guide](intro.ipynb). Here you can get a brief introduction to avaiable APIs in DECADES and get access to more documentation about them.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We recommend, next, to review these four documents:\n",
    " - **[Introduction to Numba and DEC++ Library:](kernel_implementation.ipynb)** This document will introduce you to programming with Python and Numba compiler as well as the DEC_Numba_Lib library we provide for rapid application development for graph applications.\n",
    " <br><br>\n",
    " - **[Guide for using DECADES kernel execution:](kernel_execution.ipynb)** This document will walk you through how you can write apps that can utilize DECADES hardware and compiler innovations.\n",
    " <br><br>\n",
    " - **[Introduction to executing Neural Net models:](tensorflow_api.ipynb)** This document will walk you through how you can utilize the DECADES platform in your Neural Networks models written with Python Tensorflow package.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    " - **[Evaluation Guide:](evaluation_guide.ipynb)** Finally, you can learn about how to evaluate the results of your tests you ran on different hardware and compiler settings through our simulator.\n",
